<h2>"..... the dog id stuck to the wall..."</h2>

<p>Plushies,Plushies we have too many,</p>
<p>Plushies, Plushies we don't want to throw out any,</p>
<p>stacked so high they scaled the wall,</p>
<p>that poor dog I don't know if it will fall,</p>
<p>I feel so bad that it's stuck on the wall,</p>
<p>I'm trying to grab it but I'm not that tall,</p>
<p>I'll try again tommorow cause I am too lazy,</p>
<p>The fact that it's still up there is crazy!</p>
